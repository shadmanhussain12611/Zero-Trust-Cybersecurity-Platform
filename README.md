# Zero Trust Cybersecurity Platform

## Overview
The Zero Trust Cybersecurity Platform is a robust and modern application designed to enhance security by implementing the Zero Trust model. It provides features such as user management, threat monitoring, event logging, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) verification.

## Features
- **User Management**: Manage user registrations and statuses.
- **Threat Monitoring**: Monitor and manage potential threats in real-time.
- **Event Logging**: View and analyze system events.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Verify user identities securely.
- **Dashboard**: Get a comprehensive overview of system health and recent events.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v20.13.1 or higher
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running
- **Git**: Version control system

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MDARBAZ18/ZeroTrustCyberSecurityPlatform.git
   cd ZeroTrustCyberSecurityPlatform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```


## Build Instructions

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. After building the frontend, compile the smart contracts to generate the necessary artifacts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

This ensures that the required JSON artifacts for the smart contracts are available for the application.

## Docker Setup
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t zero-trust-cybersecurity .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5173:5173 zero-trust-cybersecurity
   ```

## Usage
- Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.
- Use the dashboard to monitor system health and manage users.

## Problem Statement
In today's digital landscape, traditional perimeter-based security models are no longer sufficient to protect sensitive data and systems. Organizations face challenges such as unauthorized access, insider threats, and evolving cyberattacks. A robust security framework is needed to ensure that no entity, whether inside or outside the network, is trusted by default.

## Solution
The Zero Trust Cybersecurity Platform addresses these challenges by implementing the Zero Trust model. This platform ensures:
- **Identity Verification**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) to verify user identities.
- **Access Control**: Strict access policies to ensure users only access what they are authorized to.
- **Threat Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and management of potential threats.
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging of system events for auditing and analysis.
- **User Management**: Efficient management of user registrations and statuses.

By adopting this platform, organizations can enhance their security posture and protect critical assets from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
